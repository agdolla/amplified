## Concepts

### Data fetching techniques

All remote data fetching happens through [SWR](https://swr.now.sh), a library created by the [Vercel](https://vercel.com) team that uses advanced cache invalidation strategies.

### Async callbacks

An async callback is a hook that receives a promise as an argument and returns an array containing two items: the wrapped promise and an execution state object that contains:

1. `isLoading`: a boolean indicating if the promise is executing
2. `result`: result value from the promise, if it succeeded
3. `error`: error thrown from the promise, if it failed
4. `wasSuccessful`: a boolean indicating if the promise execution was successful
